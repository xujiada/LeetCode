Implement Queue using Stacks
==
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue. <br>  
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue. <br>  
peek() -- Get the front element. <br>  
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty. <br>  

Notes: <br>  
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid. <br>  
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack. <br>  
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).


使用两个栈实现一个队列，注意判断栈2是否为空。
