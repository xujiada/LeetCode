Symmetric Tree 
====
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree is symmetric: <br>
    1 <br>
   / \ <br>
  2   2 <br>
 / \ / \ <br>
3  4 4  3 <br>
But the following is not: <br>
    1 <br>
   / \ <br> 
  2   2 <br>
   \      \ <br>
   3     3 <br>
Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
