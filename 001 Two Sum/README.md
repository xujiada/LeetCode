Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2

所写算法的时间为O(n^2);是效率比较差的情况，而且在LeetCode OJ上运行会出现错误，而在VS上就不会出现这种错误。可以的话还是得找出效率更高的算法。
